            I am very passionate about soccer.
            Soccer makes me feel confident and ecstatic. I usually play it in the afternoon.
            what is soccer about???
            Soccer, also called association football, is a game involving two teams of 11 players who try to maneuver the ball into the other team's goal without using their hands or arms. The team that scores more goals wins. Soccer is the world's most popular ball game in numbers of participants and spectators.
            Today, soccer remains most popular in the countries where it first took root â€“ Northern and Southern Europe, and Central and South America.
